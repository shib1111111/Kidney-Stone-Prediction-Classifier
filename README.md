# Kidney-Stone-Prediction-Classifier

This model is a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have kidney stones or not. It uses various numerical features such as age, medical history, and other factors to make this prediction. The model has been trained on a dataset containing 414 entries and tested on a separate dataset containing 276 entries. The code for the model is written in Python using popular libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. The model has been designed to help healthcare professionals predict kidney stones in patients and improve treatment outcomes.
