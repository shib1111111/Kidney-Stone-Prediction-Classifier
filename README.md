# Kidney Stone Prediction Classifier

## Overview

The Kidney Stone Prediction Classifier is a binary classification model developed to predict whether a patient is likely to have kidney stones based on various numerical features. This model aids healthcare professionals in making informed decisions for early detection and improved treatment outcomes.

## Dataset

The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of 414 entries, with a separate test dataset containing 276 entries. The dataset includes diverse information such as age, medical history, and other relevant factors, contributing to the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

## Code

The model is implemented in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities. The code is well-organized, making it easy for developers and healthcare professionals to understand and potentially customize for specific use cases.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
